1. What is a support vector?
Support vectors are the data points that lie closest to the decision boundary (or hyperplane) in an SVM model. 
These points are critical because they "support" or define the position of the hyperplane. 
Specifically:
Support vectors are the data points that are either on the margin boundary or inside the margin (in case of soft margin SVM).
They are the most difficult points to classify and have the most direct influence on determining the optimal hyperplane.
If you were to remove all other points in the dataset except for the support vectors, the SVM would still generate the exact same decision boundary.
Mathematically, support vectors are the points where the constraints in the optimization problem are active, meaning they have non-zero Lagrange multipliers.

2. What does the C parameter do?
The C parameter is a regularization parameter that controls the trade-off between achieving a low training error and a low testing error (i.e., the ability to generalize to unseen data).
Small C values: Create a wider margin that allows more margin violations (more points can be on the wrong side of the margin or hyperplane), which may lead to more misclassifications but potentially better generalization.
Large C values: Lead to a narrower margin that allows fewer margin violations, trying to classify all training examples correctly but potentially overfitting to the training data.
In mathematical terms, C determines the penalty for misclassification in the objective function of the SVM optimization problem. 
It's essentially the inverse of the regularization strength.

3. What are kernels in SVM?
Kernels in SVM are functions that transform the input data into a higher-dimensional space to make non-linearly separable data linearly separable. 
This is known as the "kernel trick" and it's one of the most powerful aspects of SVM.
The kernel trick allows SVMs to model complex decision boundaries without explicitly computing the transformation of data points to higher dimensions, which would be computationally expensive. 
Instead, kernels compute the dot product of data points in the transformed space directly.

Common kernel functions include:
Linear kernel: K(x,y) = x·y
Polynomial kernel: K(x,y) = (x·y + c)^d
Radial Basis Function (RBF)/Gaussian kernel: K(x,y) = exp(-γ||x-y||²)
Sigmoid kernel: K(x,y) = tanh(αx·y + c)

4. What is the difference between linear and RBF kernel?
Linear Kernel:

Maps input data to the same dimensional space (no transformation)
Creates a linear decision boundary (a straight line in 2D, a plane in 3D, etc.)
Works well when data is linearly separable
Has fewer hyperparameters (only C)
Generally faster to train and more interpretable
Feature importance can be directly obtained from the coefficients

RBF (Radial Basis Function) Kernel:

Maps input data to an infinite-dimensional space
Creates a non-linear decision boundary that can capture more complex patterns
Works well with non-linearly separable data
Has additional hyperparameters (γ and C)
Generally needs more tuning and can be slower to train
More flexible but potentially more prone to overfitting
Feature importance cannot be directly determined

The RBF kernel measures the similarity between points based on their distance. 
The γ parameter determines how far the influence of a single training example reaches - low values mean 'far' and high values mean 'close'.

5. What are the advantages of SVM?

Effective in high-dimensional spaces, even when the number of dimensions exceeds the number of samples.
Memory efficient since it uses only a subset of training points (support vectors) in the decision function.
Versatile through different kernel functions that can be specified for the decision function.
Robust against overfitting, especially in high-dimensional space, due to the regularization parameter.
Theoretically well-founded with a clear mathematical formulation based on structural risk minimization.
Good generalization performance when properly tuned.
Can handle non-linear decision boundaries effectively using appropriate kernels.
Works well with both structured and unstructured data (text, images, etc.)
Can provide probabilistic outputs with proper calibration.

6. Can SVMs be used for regression?
Yes, SVMs can be adapted for regression tasks through a method called Support Vector Regression (SVR). 
The key differences from classification are:
Instead of finding a hyperplane that maximizes the margin between classes, SVR finds a function that deviates from the measured values by a value no greater than ε (epsilon) for each training point.
It aims to fit as many instances as possible within the ε-margin while balancing the trade-off for allowing some points to fall outside this margin.
SVR introduces an ε-insensitive loss function that ignores errors that are within ε distance of the true value.
Like SVM for classification, SVR can use different kernels to handle non-linear regression problems and has similar hyperparameters (C, epsilon, and kernel parameters like γ).

7. What happens when data is not linearly separable?
When data is not linearly separable, SVMs can handle this in two ways:

Soft Margin Classification:
Allows some misclassifications to achieve a better overall fit
Controlled by the C parameter, which determines the penalty for misclassification
Balances between maximizing the margin and minimizing classification errors


Kernel Transformation:
Maps data into a higher-dimensional space where it becomes linearly separable
Uses the kernel trick to efficiently compute relationships without explicitly transforming data
Common kernels for non-linear data include RBF, polynomial, and sigmoid kernels
The proper kernel choice depends on the data's inherent structure

These approaches allow SVMs to create complex, non-linear decision boundaries even when the original data cannot be separated by a simple hyperplane.

8. How is overfitting handled in SVM?
Overfitting in SVMs is primarily handled through:

Regularization Parameter (C):
Lower C values increase regularization, creating a wider margin that's less tailored to individual training points
Higher C values reduce regularization, potentially leading to overfitting

Kernel Parameters:
For RBF kernel, a smaller gamma (γ) value creates a smoother decision boundary less likely to overfit
For polynomial kernel, lower degree values create simpler boundaries

Cross-validation:
K-fold cross-validation helps find optimal hyperparameters that generalize well
Grid search or randomized search across hyperparameter space identifies the best combination

Feature Selection/Reduction:
Reducing unnecessary features helps prevent the model from learning noise
Techniques like PCA can be used before applying SVM to reduce dimensionality

Sufficient Training Data:
Ensuring adequate training data relative to feature dimensionality helps prevent overfitting

By properly tuning these aspects, SVMs can achieve a good balance between fitting the training data and generalizing to new, unseen data.
